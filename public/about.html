<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a gameplay programmer with a comprehensive knowledge of C# with Unity,
   having an interest in game programming design patterns to create modular, clear, 
   reusable code.</p>

<p>I also have an affinity for providing technical support and explaining tech issues.
  I have a degree in Computer Games Technology where I gained a flavour of all aspects
  of Game Design such as art, code and audio (which I was particularly passionate about
  at the time). </p>

<p>I recently completed the Mastered 16 week intensive Games Programmer (Unity) Skills
  Bootcamp and since then have been upskilling in VR as well as Web Development.</p>
